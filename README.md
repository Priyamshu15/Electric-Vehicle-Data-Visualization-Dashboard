# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Visualization-Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard built using a dataset of over 23,000 electric vehicle (EV) records across counties and cities. This project visualizes key insights like CAFV eligibility, electric range trends, MSRP comparisons, and EV adoption by brand and model year using PivotTables, slicers, and KPI visualizations.
